# SE-4488: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the code developed during in-class live coding sessions for the **SE-4488: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning** course. The code serves as a practical resource for students and practitioners to understand and implement core reinforcement learning (RL) methods and concepts.

## Implemented Reinforcement Learning Methods
The repository includes implementations of the following RL techniques:

### **Dynamic Programming**
- **Value Iteration**
- **Policy Evaluation**
- **Policy Iteration**

### **Monte Carlo Methods**
- **Monte Carlo Evaluation**
- **Monte Carlo Control**

### **Temporal Difference Methods**
- **SARSA**
- **TD(0)** (Temporal Difference Zero)
- **Q-Learning**

### **Advanced Topics**
- **Dyna Architecture**
- **Function Approximation**

## Implemented MDP Environments (Tasks)
The following environments are implemented as examples of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs):

- **Multi-armed Bandit**
- **Blackjack**
- **Grid Maze**
- **Random Walk**
- **ROD Maneuvering**
- **Recycler Robot**
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**

These environments are designed to help students experiment with and understand the application of RL algorithms to diverse tasks.

## Features
- **Interactive Learning**: Code was written live during lectures to ensure clarity and step-by-step understanding.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers foundational RL methods and advanced concepts.
- **Environment Variety**: Provides a range of tasks for hands-on experimentation with different RL techniques.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/se4488-rl-lecture-code.git
   ```
2. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Explore the `src` folder for implementations of RL methods and environments.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher

## Usage
Each RL method and environment is self-contained and can be run independently. Check the `tasks` directory for sample classes demonstrating the usage of the methods on different environments.
